  resultTitle: Moderate Empathy
  result: You can empathize with others, but not all the time. While you generally
    understand people's emotions, you may not always feel deeply affected by them.
    You show compassion when needed but also maintain a balance between others' feelings
    and your own emotional boundaries.
