  result: An asocial person generally avoids social interactions and prefers spending
    time alone. Crowded environments or large groups can feel overwhelming. Interacting
    with others may seem uncomfortable or unnecessary at times. You prefer individual
    activities over social situations and generally don't enjoy connecting with others.
